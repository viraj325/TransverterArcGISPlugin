RTC Transverter plugin is for ArcGIS users that want to save time by automatically selecting similar data from shapefile(s) and generating a layout in pdf. This is all done with intiutive and simple UI.

## How to use it
Either create a new script in ArcGIS and copy the code from both of the python files or download the .gpkx file and add that into the project folder.
- Recommend downloading .gpkx file.
