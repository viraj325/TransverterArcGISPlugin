## What is it?
RTC Transverter plugin is for ArcGIS users that want to save time by automatically selecting similar data from shapefile(s) and generating a layout in pdf. This is all done with intiutive and simple UI.

## How to use it
Either create a new script in ArcGIS and copy the code from both of the python files or download the .gpkx file and add that into the project folder.
- Recommend downloading .gpkx file.

## Contribute or Customize?
Of course! I have made the files public so that anyone can alter the code and use it for their purpose under MIT open source license. The altered code can also be used for commercial purposes.

## Further questions or assitance
Go over the manual for specific details on how to start.

## Vision Statement
For GIS students/analysts
who are looking to visualize spatial features that share similar attributes,
the RTC Transverter
is an exploratory tool
that will highlight the spatial features based on the selected field, value, and range.
Unlike current exploratory tools in ArcGIS,
our product is intuitive and simple while also providing all the related information about the highlighted
feature(s).

## Background Story
RTC Transverter was created as a college existing project by my partner Milan and I. Although after releasing the first version and getting great feedback and response, we decided to make this public and as of right now, many OSU students are using this plugin for their labs.
